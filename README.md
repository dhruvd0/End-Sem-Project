## Disclaimer
The contributors of this application do not own lms.bennett.edu.in and its resources.
We do not want to show Lms in a bad light, it is just that our app has additional capabilities which may help the students.
Our app provides important additional features required to the students related to the LMS and there is still scope to add more things. 
This is a working prototype and does not have all the features of lms , not yet.
